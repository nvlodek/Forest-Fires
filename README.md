# Forest-Fires
In this project, my goal was to predict the burned area of Forest Fires in Montesinho Natural Park. I used the Forest Fires dataset avaliable at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires).

Forest fires are becoming more and more frequent, due to global climate change. The aim of this project is to predict the burned area of forest fires in Montesinho Natural Park, in northern Portugal. The dataset uses the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (CWFIS), which consists of six components that account for the effects of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behavior. Different machine learning algorithms are used in this project, including the Gradient Boosting (gradient boosting) and Gradient Regression (grade gradient boosting). The results show that the model can learn from previous errors, which can be helpful when trying to find complex patterns in data. This is an imperative technique in machine learning because it is important to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data to prevent overfitting.
